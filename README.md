#  Smart Credit Card Fraud Detection

A machine learning-powered tool to intelligently detect suspicious credit card transactions in real time â€” designed for analysts, security teams, and anyone dealing with high-volume transaction data.

---

##  What It Does

This application helps you identify fraudulent transactions **as they happen**, even when dealing with highly imbalanced data (where fraud is rare but costly). Using a trained logistic regression model behind a simple UI, users can upload transaction files, get immediate predictions, and visually assess model performance â€” all from their browser.

##  How It Works

Instead of a bulky dashboard or enterprise software, this is a **Streamlit-based interface** backed by a **Python-powered ML engine**. It scans uploaded CSV files, preprocesses the data (like scaling features), and instantly classifies transactions as either **legitimate** or **fraudulent**.

Admins get extra control â€” they can upload newer models, manage users, and even configure detection settings.

##  Application Modules

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of whatâ€™s included:

###  Authentication
- Users can securely log in
- Admins have extended privileges (model & user management)

###  Upload Interface
- Simple CSV uploader for credit card transaction data

###  Prediction Engine
- Powered by a pre-trained **Logistic Regression model**
- Real-time prediction of each transaction
- Confidence score and probability-based feedback

###  Metrics + Evaluation
- Evaluation scores: **Accuracy**, **Precision**, **Recall**, **F1-score**
- Confusion Matrix visualization
- Summary of fraud stats (e.g., how many flagged out of total)

###  Admin Controls
- Upload/manage ML models and scalers
- Track model versions

###  Customization
- Light/dark mode toggle
- Control notification behavior

##  Under the Hood

The system follows a clean **client-server architecture**:

- **Frontend**: Built with Streamlit for fast prototyping and sleek UI
- **Backend**: Python handles all logic, including:
  - Model loading
  - Data preprocessing
  - Prediction & metrics
- **ML Engine**: Trained with `scikit-learn`, tuned to handle imbalanced classes using `imblearn`
